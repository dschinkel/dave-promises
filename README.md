# Dave's Promises
I TDD my own Promise Library to learn how promises work.

## Installation
#### Run

1. git clone https://github.com/dschinkel/dave-promises.git
2. npm install

## Testing

#### Run via Command-line

1. gulp test
               
#### Run Using Webstorm's Test Runner

This is for if you're using webstorm and want to use it's test runner rather than command-line to run the tests

**Setup**

1. Create a new Debug Config in Webstorm
2. Set the test path to the test root directory & select to include subdirectories
3. Run - Shift + Function + F10 to run tests
4. Debug - Set a breakpoint somewhere then Shift + Function + F9 and it should hit your breakpoint
